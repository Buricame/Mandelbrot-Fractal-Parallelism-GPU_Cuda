<u><b>**Mandelbrot Fractal Parallelism GPU(Cuda)**<u><b>

This project demonstrates generating the Mandelbrot fractal using GPU parallelization with CUDA. Created for learning purposes.

<u><b>**Features**<u><b>

- **GPU Parallelization:** Utilizes CUDA to perform computations on the GPU, significantly accelerating the generation process.
- **Custom Resolution:** The resolution of the generated image can be customized. Default resolution: 1920x1080 pixels.
- **Custom Iteration Limit:** The maximum number of iterations for calculating the Mandelbrot set can be customized. Default: 1000 iterations.
- **BMP Output:** The generated fractal image is saved in BMP format as mandelbrot.bmp in the same directory as the executable.
- **Execution Time:** Measures and prints the execution time in milliseconds.

<u><b>**Requirements**<u><b>

- **CUDA Toolkit**
- **NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support**
- **C++ Compiler**
